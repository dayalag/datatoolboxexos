# datatoolboxexos

This repository contains the code and data I used during the datatoolbox
CESAB workshop exercices. The courses and exercices of the workshop are
obtainable [here](https://github.com/FRBCesab/datatoolbox).

### How to cite

Please cite this compendium as:

> Authors, (2020). *Compendium of R code and data for CESAB datatoolbox
> workshop exercices*. Accessed 04 Nov 2020. Online at
> <https://github.com/FRBCesab/datatoolboxexos> \#\# Contents

The [**data**](data/) directory contains the data sets used in the
analyses. There is a `README` in that directory that describes the data
sets.

The [**exercices**](exercices/) directory contains and `.Rmd` file for
each exercice:

  - [::spiral\_notepad:: exo\_dplyr](/exercices/exo_dplyr.Rmd)
  - [::spiral\_notepad:: exo\_spatial](/exercices/exo_spatial.Rmd)

Each R Markdown source document for the exercices includes code to
reproduce the figures and tables generated by the analyses. They also
have rendered versions, `.md` and `html` suitable respectively for
reading on github and in a web browser.

## How to run it ?

This research compendium has been developed using the statistical
programming language R. To work with the compendium, you will need
installed on your computer the [R
software](https://cloud.r-project.org/) itself and optionally [RStudio
Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

You can download the compendium as a zip from from this URL:
[master.zip](/archive/master.zip). After unzipping:

  - open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio

  - open `make.R` and source it to ensure you have the packages these
    analyses depends on (also listed in the [DESCRIPTION](/DESCRIPTION)
    file under `Imports`) and produce the reports for all the
    exercercices.
